Description: This package takes data on organism isotopes and fits a
        Bayesian model to their dietary habits based upon a Gaussian
        likelihood with a mixture dirichlet-distributed prior on the
        mean. It also includes SiBER metrics. See siardemo() for an
        example. Version 4.1.2 contains bug fixes to allow more than
        isotope numbers other than 2. Version 4.2 fixes a bug that
        stopped siar working on 64-bit systems. Version 4.2.1 fixes a bug in
        SIBER routines in Linux distirubutions and now siardensityplot()'s
        main="my awesome graph" argument works. Version 4.2.2 fixes a bug in
        SIAR when running it on a single group of data.
