# specified using the group and commmunity indices above.

# n = 100 just determines how many points are used to draw a smooth ellipse.
# p.interval = 0.95 for a 95% ellipse of the data
# ci.mean = FALSE as we are not plotting an ellipse around the mean.
# col = your choice of colour.
# lty = your choice of line type.
