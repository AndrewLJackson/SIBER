#' Read in SIBER format data and generate the SIBER object
#' 
#' This function takes raw isotope data and creates a SIBER object which 
#' contains information in a structured manner that enables other functions to 
#' loop over groups and communities, fit Bayesian ellipses, and afterwards, 
#' generate various plots, and additional analyses on the posterior 
#' distributions.
#' 
#' @param data.in Specified In a basic R data.frame or matrix comprising 4 
#'   columns. The first two of which are typically isotope tracers, then the 
#'   third is a column that indicates the group membership, and the fourth 
#'   column indicates the community membership of an observation. Communities 
#'   labels should be entered  as sequetial numbers. As of v2.0.1 group labels 
#'   can be entered as strings and/or numbers and need not be sequential.
#' @return A siber list object, that contains data that helps with various model
#'   fitting and plotting. \itemize{ \item {original.data}{The original data as
#'   passed into this function} \item {iso.summary}{The max, min, mean and
#'   median of the isotope data useful for plotting} \item {sample.sizees}{The
#'   number of obsevations tabulated by group and community} \item {raw.data}{A
#'   list object of length equal to the number of communities} }
