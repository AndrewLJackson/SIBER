#' Calculates the boundary of a union of ellipses
#' 
#' Intended to calculate the area of an ellipse as a proportion of a group of 
#' ellipses represented by their union, i.e. the total area encompassed by all 
#' ellipses superimposed.
#' 
#' @param dtf a data.frame object comprising bivariate data as a requirement, 
#'   and possibly other variables too but these are currently ignored.
#' @param isoNames a character vector of length 2 providing the names of the 
#'   variables containing the x and y data respectively.
#' @param group a character vector of length 1 providing the name of the 
#'   grouping variable on which to calculate the KAPOW ellipse.
#' @param pEll the probability ellipse to draw for each group. Defaults to the 
#'   Standard Ellipse with \code{pEll = stats::pchisq(1, df = 2)}.
#'   
#' @return an object of class \code{owin} containing the numerically calculated
#'   ellipses and their union along with the raw ellipse boundaries in both raw
#'   and \code{owin} format.
