An update to the package `spatstat` on which `SIBER` depends has precipiated a minor version update. My package now uses `spatsat.utils` as per the advice of the dependent package maintainers. There were also some warnings thrown by inappropriate vignette builder options in the yaml headers which have now all been fixed. All issues in the package reports https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_SIBER.html have been addressed.
