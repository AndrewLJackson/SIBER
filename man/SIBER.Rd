\title{SIBER: A package for fitting Bayesian Ellipses to Stable Isotope Data}
\description{
The SIBER package provides tools for fitting multivariate normal 
distributions to bivariate data using Bayesian Inference. These
distributions can then be used to calculate probability 
distributions of Standard Ellipse Areas for comparing groups of data,
or to calculate the 6 Layman metrics for comparing entire communities.
