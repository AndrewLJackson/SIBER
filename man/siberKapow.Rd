\title{Calculates the boundary of a union of ellipses}
\usage{
siberKapow(
  dtf,
  isoNames = c("iso1", "iso2"),
  group = "group",
  pEll = stats::pchisq(1, df = 2)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dtf}{a data.frame object comprising bivariate data as a requirement, 
and possibly other variables too but these are currently ignored.}

\item{isoNames}{a character vector of length 2 providing the names of the 
variables containing the x and y data respectively.}

\item{group}{a character vector of length 1 providing the name of the 
grouping variable on which to calculate the KAPOW ellipse.}

\item{pEll}{the probability ellipse to draw for each group. Defaults to the 
Standard Ellipse with \code{pEll = stats::pchisq(1, df = 2)}.}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{owin} containing the numerically calculated
  ellipses and their union along with the raw ellipse boundaries in both raw
  and \code{owin} format.
}
\description{
Intended to calculate the area of an ellipse as a proportion of a group of 
ellipses represented by their union, i.e. the total area encompassed by all 
ellipses superimposed.
