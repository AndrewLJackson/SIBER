\title{Fit a multivariate normal distribution to x and y data using jags}
\usage{
fitEllipse(x, y, parms, priors, id = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of data representing the x-axis}

\item{y}{a vector of data representing the y-axis}

\item{parms}{a list containing four items providing details of the 
\code{\link[rjags]{rjags}} run to be sampled. \itemize{ \item {n.iter}{The 
number of iterations to sample} \item {n.burnin}{The number of iterations 
to discard as a burnin from the start of sampling.} \item {n.thin}{The 
number of samples to thin by.} \item {n.chains}{The number of chains to 
fit.} }}

\item{priors}{a list of three items specifying the priors to be passed to the
jags model. \itemize{ \item {R}{The scaling vector for the diagonal of 
Inverse Wishart distribution prior on the covariance matrix Sigma. 
Typically set to a 2x2 matrix matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), 2, 2).} \item {k}{The 
degrees of freedom of the Inverse Wishart distribution for the covariance 
matrix Sigma. Typically set to the dimensionality of Sigma, which in this 
bivariate case is 2.} \item {tau}{The precision on the normal prior on the 
means mu.} }}

\item{id}{a character string to prepend to the raw saved jags model output. 
This is typically passed on from the calling function 
\code{\link{siberMVN}} and identifies the community and group with an 
integer labelling system. Defaults to NULL which will prevent the output 
object being saved even if \code{parms$save.output} is set to \code{TRUE}.
The file itself will be saved to the user-specified location via
\code{parms$save.dir}.}
}
\value{
A mcmc.list object of posterior samples created by jags.
}
\description{
This function contains and defines the jags model script used to fit a 
bivariate normal distribution to a vector of x and y data. Although not 
intended for direct calling by users, it presents a quick way to fit a model 
to a single group of data. Advanced users should be able to manipulate the 
contained jags model to fit more complex models using different likelihoods, 
such as multivariate lognormal distributions, multivariate gamma 
distributions etc...
