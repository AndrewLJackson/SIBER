Ellipse and convex hull fitting package to estimate niche width for stable isotope data (and potentially other relevant types of bivariate data).

[MixSIAR](https://github.com/brianstock/MixSIAR) is intended to encompass all the mixing model functionality in the [SIAR package](http://www.tcd.ie/Zoology/research/groups/jackson/projects/siar.php). Additionally, we have updated the basic mixing model from SIAR and released this as a standalone package for basic mixing model fitting as [simmr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simmr/). 


## Installation
The latest stable release package is released on CRAN as v2.1.5. Type `install.packages("SIBER")` in the command line.

Alternatively, you can install directly from github

The stable release can be installed by
  ```R
    # install.packages("devtools") # install if necessary
    devtools::install_github("andrewljackson/SIBER@v2.1.5", 
    build_vignettes = TRUE)
    library(SIBER)
  ```
[Release notes]("NEWS.md") are available for each version.

The latest development version is on the master branch. Often this includes some new things that I am working on, but I can't guarantee that the package is stable and it might not install sometimes if I have broken something; usually though I tend to break things on a separate branch and try to keep the master stable as a package even if bits and pieces of the new stuff is not working correctly.

  ```R
    # install.packages("devtools") # install if necessary
    devtools::install_github("andrewljackson/SIBER@master",
    build_vignettes = TRUE)
    library(SIBER)
  ```


## Tutorials
More information and examples from the previous version of SIBER which is part of the SIAR package is available from [my website](http://www.tcd.ie/Zoology/research/groups/jackson/projects/Rpodcasts.php#siber). Much of this instructional content remains true, although the implementation of the code has changed substantially (for the better I hope).

The package vignettes provide working examples of the two main analysis types.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

* __How do I make isotope plots in ggplot?__ - see this [code example](https://github.com/andrewcparnell/simms_course/blob/master/aj-content/practicals/day-1-pm1/first-scatterplot.Rmd) or the new vignette "Plot-SIA-ggplot2" included in the development version >2.1.5.9000. Install via `devtools::install_github("andrewljackson/SIBER@master",
  build_vignettes = TRUE)`
* __Why are my community-level estimates of TA are zero or NA__ - This will arise if you have less than three groups (e.g. species) comprising a community. A triangle with three non-collinear points is the minimum requirement to draw a polygon and so if you have only one or two groups, the area of the TA is zero at best or possibly NA.

## Help, Assistance and Queries
In the first instance, queries about analyses or problems with the software can be posted [here on github](https://github.com/AndrewLJackson/SIBER/issues). Please post minimal worked examples so that we can recreate the problem and offer solutions.

##Acknowledgements
Some code and much input from my collaborator and co-author [Andrew Parnell](http://mathsci.ucd.ie/people/parnell_a) [@aparnellstats](https://twitter.com/aparnellstats). Thanks to Alex Bond [@thelabandfield](https://twitter.com/thelabandfield) for helping identify some problems in model fitting which is now resolved by z-scoring, fitting and back-transforming. Although not affecting every analysis, the potential issue is exemplified in [SIBER-sandbox]( https://github.com/AndrewLJackson/SIBER-sandbox). Thanks to [Edward Doherty](https://github.com/Edward-Doherty) for finding the bug that turned out to be in the creating of z-scores in `createSiberObject`.
