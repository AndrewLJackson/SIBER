SIBER
=====

ellipse and convex hull fitting package for stable isotope data

MixSIAR is intended to encompass all the mixing model functionality in the SIAR package. SIAR development will stop,
and the SIBER routines will become orphaned. This is the start of a full recode of SIBER to be a standalone package. 
Also intended are some major improvements to model fitting, via z-scoring and back-transforming to improve fitting 
via MCMC in JAGS. 

Comments and suggestions welcome. If anyone wants to contribute code, please let me know and we can chat about how 
to proceed.
